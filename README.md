# Hummingbird-KiCad

## Latest Updates

Feb 23, 2024 (Victor H., Sam C., Jesse F., Luis S. and Pete!): Modified the KiCad schematic to include correct numbers of PTs, TTs, LCs, etc. (based on P&ID V4). Schematics are organized hierarchically. Problem: Still need to check for input/output conflicts. Action item: can add custom connector footprints next time.
